# ROADMAP

- Add a database to persist stacks

  for example just a table with stacks serialized as a json field

- Devops : containerize services with docker-compose

- Add operations common in calculators:

  - scientific operations (square, cube, power, square root, ...)
  - store in memory
  - append / clear position x
  - undo
